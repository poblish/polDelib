<a name="a-last-gasp-for-online-political-deliberation" class="anchor" href="#a-last-gasp-for-online-political-deliberation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A last gasp for online political deliberation?</h1>

<h3>
<a name="deliberative-democracy" class="anchor" href="#deliberative-democracy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deliberative democracy</h3>

<ul>
<li>Wide range of opinions and evidence, to be considered fairly.</li>
<li>A more efficient decision-making process.</li>
<li>More effective (‘better’) decisions (we hope).</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="whats-the-problem" class="anchor" href="#whats-the-problem"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's the problem?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Parliamentary process corrupted by policy, party (prejudice, bias), and power.</li>
<li>Deliberation carried out by delegates with many responsibilities, under control of political managers.</li>
<li>Self-interest of existing political actors.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="the-problem-ii" class="anchor" href="#the-problem-ii"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The problem II</h3>

<p>All online political deliberation exercises (Flashes-in-the-pan like MixedInk, Debategraph, Google Moderator, "crowdsourcing", ...) have failed, leaving only:</p>

<ul>
<li>The cliquey world of influence/Twitter.</li>
<li>For the powerless, online polls &amp; petitions.</li>
</ul><p>Online deliberation has no credibility, either at the top or at the bottom.</p>

<h3>
<a name="the-problem-iii" class="anchor" href="#the-problem-iii"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The problem III</h3>

<p>Corruption, rent-seeking, bias, groupthink are too high a price to pay to elevate authority and expertise (genuine or self-described - we're not talking scientific/technical expertise here)</p>

<p>=&gt; Algorithmic filtering by rank/reputation is dangerous. Prefer self-filtering to minimise noise.</p>

<p>Randomness is safer and fairer...</p>

<h3>
<a name="the-problem-iv" class="anchor" href="#the-problem-iv"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The problem IV</h3>

<p>Everyone's got a campaign to push, but no responsibility to others. All compromise a sell-out.</p>

<p>Campaigners' dream: embed within Govt, use influence in private.</p>

<p>In short: incentives are all wrong.</p>

<h3>
<a name="the-problem-representativeness" class="anchor" href="#the-problem-representativeness"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The problem: representativeness</h3>

<p>Existing attempts to thwart perceived bias defeat purpose of deliberation: diversity of ‘identity’ trumps diversity of thought, corrupted by irrelevant political priorities.</p>

<p>Again, bad/corrupt deliberation too high a price to pay to get the ‘best people’.</p>

<h3>
<a name="making-deliberation-fun" class="anchor" href="#making-deliberation-fun"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Making deliberation fun</h3>

<p>Gamification?... good starting point.</p>

<p>Incentivise people to take political questions seriously. Make cheating impossible.</p>

<p>Yes, reputation: to brush egos, not filtering</p>

<p>Also get the process right.</p>

<h2>
<a name="a-solution" class="anchor" href="#a-solution"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A solution...</h2>

<h3>
<a name="a-solution-online-juries" class="anchor" href="#a-solution-online-juries"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A solution: online juries</h3>

<p>Key points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Random selection: reduce 1% problem</li>
<li>"Interest" vs. "interest": keenness/curiosity, not advantage/expectation.</li>
<li>Independence, not authority/expertise.</li>
<li>Universal, not just UK (boring!)</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="but-why-juries" class="anchor" href="#but-why-juries"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>But why <em>juries</em>?</h3>

<p>No shortage of online opinion, argument, evidence, and both good and bad intentions (standard model) = useless to policymakers</p>

<p>Few willing to take time/find ways to actually resolve issues =&gt; individuals &gt; void &gt; State</p>

<p>Need institutions &amp; processes for deliberation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Formal institutions =&gt; Rent-seeking (increasingly?)</li>
<li>Informal institutions, but with common purpose =&gt; might just work</li>
</ul><p><strong>Don't want</strong>: a multitude of answers - competing, overlapping answers - from biased, interested people ("pick by authority"). So not Stack Overflow or Yahoo! Answers, etc.</p>

<p>A structured process of deliberation =&gt; one answer, or none.</p>

<p>(Not everything can be answered)</p>

<h3>
<a name="anonymity" class="anchor" href="#anonymity"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Anonymity</h3>

<p>Anonymity is important:</p>

<ul>
<li>Escape the silo.</li>
<li>"Face": if people refuse to change their minds - or engage with differing views - or feel they have to show off to certain people - in public, how can they be given a safe environment to let them do so? (Then again, results also need to be public... how to square that...)</li>
</ul><p>￼￼￼￼<strong>Not</strong> <em>totally</em> anonymous.</p>

<p>Jurors <strong>must</strong> trust that their fellows are real human beings, just as real-life juries.</p>

<p>=&gt; OK to show user's "display name" and locality, provided they cannot be contacted "outside the bubble".
￼
￼### Vs. parliamentary democracy</p>

<ul>
<li>Not party political, but criticism of existing political processes, and pessimism about alternatives, is implied.</li>
<li>Yes, aspire to take back deliberative powers from Parliaments, by presenting more efficient and more effective alternative.
￼￼￼￼* Scalability: continuous process, not limited by political timetables, calculations, availability of delegates.</li>
<li>Any kind of decision within any kind of organisation.</li>
</ul><p>But then who organises it...? See ‘Questions: who?’
￼
￼### Political legitimacy</p>

<p>￼￼￼￼Ignore question of political legitimacy entirely.
Ultimately all decisions will be enacted by politicians / questioner.
However, if decisions must be made, and questions answered, let the process be informed, efficient, and effective.
￼
￼￼## How might this work?</p>

<p>￼￼￼￼### Overview</p>

<p>￼￼￼￼1. Register as Juror
2. Declare favoured topics (curated list)
3. Wait for call...
4. Agree to call or declare interest/objection.
5. Process is private, anonymous.
6. Make good points = +rep
7. Flag bad points (-rep)
8. Resolution reached (+rep for all)
9. Results go public.
￼
￼￼￼￼Questioner may post time-limit (perhaps)
￼</p>

<h3>
<a name="selection-process" class="anchor" href="#selection-process"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>￼Selection process</h3>

<p>￼￼￼￼Question may be tagged with n categories.
1. Obtain list of all members who cover at least one of those categories.
2. Randomly select 12, + 12 stand-bys.
3. Send invites - need response within d days.
4. No response =&gt; -1 rep
5. Objection =&gt; OK, next time.
6. Pick first 12 who accept.
￼
￼### Jury size</p>

<p>￼￼￼￼Not necessarily 12.
Larger numbers for harder tasks =&gt; more time
(use some formula).
Suggest questioner needs more Rep to be able
to call on larger numbers.
Not sure about min, max.
￼￼</p>

<h3>
<a name="deliberation-process" class="anchor" href="#deliberation-process"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>￼Deliberation process</h3>

<p>￼￼￼￼Wholly online. Essentially a free-form or threaded comment approach to working through the issues. Collaborative/wiki editing facility to produce the one single answer.
+rep for good responses, -rep for bad/disruptive ones. Kept even if no resolution. Also fun SO-style "badges".
Questioner may be able to guide process (see later)
(Jurors may drop out and be replaced)
￼</p>

<h3>
<a name="users-who" class="anchor" href="#users-who"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>￼Users: who?</h3>

<p>￼￼￼￼Anyone (probably English-speaking)
... who has provided enough information to at least give us a chance of stopping sockpuppetry...
No expertise required.
￼</p>

<h3>
<a name="questions-what" class="anchor" href="#questions-what"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>￼Questions: what?</h3>

<p>￼￼￼￼Want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes/no questions.</li>
<li>Pick good/logical arguments, eliminate bad*
arguments from piece X.</li>
<li>11-1, 12-0 votes.</li>
</ul><p>Do not want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create/rewrite piece X.</li>
<li>Two answers (left/right split, etc.)</li>
<li>7-5, 8-4 votes.
￼
￼￼￼￼There will be clean-up:</li>
<li>Suggest similar questions (SO-style) to suppress duplicates.</li>
<li>Bad/unanswerable questions can be rejected (SO-style).</li>
<li>+rep for curating users.</li>
</ul><p>(Need some examples - and to work through some for real!)
￼
￼￼￼￼So, no need to worry about question suitability, or be put off asking:</p>

<ul>
<li>If question is rejected, try again until it can be answered.</li>
<li>Make it worth answering to get best results. =&gt; Ensure process works for both sides
￼
### ￼Questions: who?</li>
</ul><p>￼￼￼￼Any registered user.
Not emergent decision-making: debates are commissioned:</p>

<ul>
<li>By/within political institutions</li>
<li>By/within companies</li>
<li>Academic interest</li>
<li>Intellectual curiosity.
￼
￼### Questions: bounties</li>
</ul><p>￼￼￼￼Just like Stack Overflow (I hope)
High rep users can allocate some of their rep to new questions, which will be shared among jurors when resolution reached.
No other kind of "sponsoring".
￼</p>

<h3>
<a name="resolution" class="anchor" href="#resolution"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>￼Resolution</h3>

<p>￼￼￼￼Questioner must be satisfied with answer for this system to be credible, get a good reputation, and convince jurors it's worth giving their best.
Must be possible for questioners to reject shoddy work (but still public)
￼</p>

<h3>
<a name="resolution-how" class="anchor" href="#resolution-how"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>￼Resolution: how?</h3>

<p>￼￼￼￼How can we be sure questioner is satisfied? Two possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>11-1 or 12-0 result. Questioner examines, either marks as accepted, or asks them to reconsider. (May not be practical)</li>
<li>Questioner has semi-read-only access to discussion. Can accept early, or intervene to guide things.
￼
￼### Keep the game going</li>
</ul><p>￼￼￼￼"Players" must be able to control how much they get to do, in spite of random element.</p>

<ul>
<li>Questions ÷ Jurors rises?: not necessarily</li>
<li>But, the more topics they choose, the more
work (as long as they maintain quality!)</li>
<li>Topics curated, split up, increased over time.
￼
￼￼￼￼Reputation and wanting-to-help should maintain interest (just like Stack Overflow)
These "games" must be a big deal for the outside world, not frivolous. Each one should get serious attention and publicity.
￼
## ￼￼Going further...
￼￼￼￼
￼### Avenues... I</li>
</ul><p>￼￼￼￼Political questions, for starters. What else? # Workplace matters?</p>

<ul>
<li>...
Not commercially viable (ads would be insane, as would be paid accounts), but fundable. What do Stack Overflow do? Could even collaborate with them.
￼
### ￼Avenues... II</li>
</ul><p>￼￼￼￼There is potential to play these out offline. For games to actually run real experiments.
To actually commission research/call for expertise.
Almost like a jury running a criminal investigation, before: charges, suspect, legal case, and courtroom.
￼</p>

<h3>
<a name="crowdsourcing" class="anchor" href="#crowdsourcing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>￼Crowdsourcing</h3>

<p>￼￼￼￼Loosen definition of "jury" a little =&gt;
"working group"
Can take part in data cleanup and research exercises, rather like The Guardian's expenses thing from 2009.
Against, not on basis of expertise, but enthusiasm.
￼￼￼
￼### Lotteries</p>

<p>￼￼￼￼Each +rep =&gt; ticket in User lottery Badges =&gt; tickets in Community lottery
E.g. Company offers 1000 prizes (money, free subs, etc.) for each, 1000 numbers to win.
Big motivator, but corruptible?
=&gt; No. Rep can't be gamed. Freely &amp; openly given by others. Doesn't affect juries/Qs/As
￼
￼￼## Questions, Issues, ...
￼￼￼￼
￼### Proper relation with Govts</p>

<p>￼￼￼￼Be an international institution, independent of all Govts.
Randomness &amp; process should ensure this, but worth making this crystal-clear to users.
Govts should come to us, to commission questions just as any other user can.
￼</p>

<h3>
<a name="cheating" class="anchor" href="#cheating"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>￼Cheating</h3>

<p>￼￼￼￼The process is entirely anonymous, so participants can't collude within the process.
May have to protect URLs to ensure they can't share links/advertise their status outside of the process.
All results ultimately go public.
￼
￼￼￼￼The public profiles of participants can then be checked against results. Those who should have declared an interest and opted-out can be questioned in public =&gt; possible big -rep or exclusion.
Minimum 50? users per question-category, so particular areas cannot be hogged by same people.
￼</p>

<h3>
<a name="random-points" class="anchor" href="#random-points"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>￼Random points</h3>

<p>￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼* International, yes, but must agree on language =&gt; English only.</p>

<ul>
<li>Self-managing wherever possible.</li>
<li>No country/age/gender monitoring/equality</li>
<li>Rep does not bring more/better work!</li>
<li>Quorum: we'll replace drop-outs up to
certain number, but if (say) 50% drop out during life time, process suspended (dropout count is hidden from participants to prevent gaming)
￼
### ￼Unresolved issues</li>
</ul><p>￼￼￼￼* Do what for -rep people?</p>

<ul>
<li>National, centralised policy-making still a
dead-end, so what's the point of resolving
anything?</li>
<li>Modelling problem (market vs. planning):
experiment, do, feed back - don't try to
resolve on paper.</li>
<li>Possibility of bias, as some categories will be
self-selecting, e.g. "gender politics" will attract a certain kind of juror. So randomness doesn't guarantee safety...</li>
