{"name":"Online Political Deliberation","tagline":"A last gasp for online political deliberation?","body":"# A last gasp for online political deliberation?\r\n\r\n### Deliberative democracy\r\n\r\n* Wide range of opinions and evidence, to be considered fairly.\r\n* A more efficient decision-making process.\r\n* More effective (‘better’) decisions (we hope).\r\n\r\n### What's the problem?\r\n\r\n* Parliamentary process corrupted by policy, party (prejudice, bias), and power.\r\n* Deliberation carried out by delegates with many responsibilities, under control of political managers.\r\n* Self-interest of existing political actors.\r\n\r\n### The problem II\r\n\r\nAll online political deliberation exercises (Flashes-in-the-pan like MixedInk, Debategraph, Google Moderator, \"crowdsourcing\", ...) have failed, leaving only:\r\n\r\n* The cliquey world of influence/Twitter.\r\n* For the powerless, online polls & petitions.\r\n\r\nOnline deliberation has no credibility, either at the top or at the bottom.\r\n\r\n### The problem III\r\n\r\nCorruption, rent-seeking, bias, groupthink are too high a price to pay to elevate authority and expertise (genuine or self-described - we're not talking scientific/technical expertise here)\r\n\r\n=> Algorithmic filtering by rank/reputation is dangerous. Prefer self-filtering to minimise noise.\r\n\r\nRandomness is safer and fairer...\r\n\r\n### The problem IV\r\n\r\nEveryone's got a campaign to push, but no responsibility to others. All compromise a sell-out.\r\n\r\nCampaigners' dream: embed within Govt, use influence in private.\r\n\r\nIn short: incentives are all wrong.\r\n\r\n### The problem: representativeness\r\n\r\nExisting attempts to thwart perceived bias defeat purpose of deliberation: diversity of ‘identity’ trumps diversity of thought, corrupted by irrelevant political priorities.\r\n\r\nAgain, bad/corrupt deliberation too high a price to pay to get the ‘best people’.\r\n\r\n### Making deliberation fun\r\n\r\nGamification?... good starting point.\r\n\r\nIncentivise people to take political questions seriously. Make cheating impossible.\r\n\r\nYes, reputation: to brush egos, not filtering\r\n\r\nAlso get the process right.\r\n\r\n## A solution...\r\n\r\n### A solution: online juries\r\n\r\nKey points:\r\n\r\n* Random selection: reduce 1% problem\r\n* \"Interest\" vs. \"interest\": keenness/curiosity, not advantage/expectation.\r\n* Independence, not authority/expertise.\r\n* Universal, not just UK (boring!)\r\n\r\n### But why _juries_?\r\n\r\nNo shortage of online opinion, argument, evidence, and both good and bad intentions (standard model) = useless to policymakers\r\n\r\nFew willing to take time/find ways to actually resolve issues => individuals > void > State\r\n\r\nNeed institutions & processes for deliberation:\r\n\r\n* Formal institutions => Rent-seeking (increasingly?)\r\n* Informal institutions, but with common purpose => might just work\r\n\r\n**Don't want**: a multitude of answers - competing, overlapping answers - from biased, interested people (\"pick by authority\"). So not Stack Overflow or Yahoo! Answers, etc.\r\n\r\nA structured process of deliberation => one answer, or none.\r\n\r\n(Not everything can be answered)\r\n\r\n### Anonymity\r\n\r\nAnonymity is important:\r\n\r\n* Escape the silo.\r\n* \"Face\": if people refuse to change their minds - or engage with differing views - or feel they have to show off to certain people - in public, how can they be given a safe environment to let them do so? (Then again, results also need to be public... how to square that...)\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼**Not** _totally_ anonymous.\r\n\r\nJurors **must** trust that their fellows are real human beings, just as real-life juries.\r\n\r\n=> OK to show user's \"display name\" and locality, provided they cannot be contacted \"outside the bubble\".\r\n￼\r\n￼### Vs. parliamentary democracy\r\n\r\n* Not party political, but criticism of existing political processes, and pessimism about alternatives, is implied.\r\n* Yes, aspire to take back deliberative powers from Parliaments, by presenting more efficient and more effective alternative.\r\n￼￼￼￼* Scalability: continuous process, not limited by political timetables, calculations, availability of delegates.\r\n* Any kind of decision within any kind of organisation.\r\n\r\nBut then who organises it...? See ‘Questions: who?’\r\n￼\r\n￼### Political legitimacy\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼Ignore question of political legitimacy entirely.\r\nUltimately all decisions will be enacted by politicians / questioner.\r\nHowever, if decisions must be made, and questions answered, let the process be informed, efficient, and effective.\r\n￼\r\n￼￼## How might this work?\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼### Overview\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼1. Register as Juror\r\n2. Declare favoured topics (curated list)\r\n3. Wait for call...\r\n4. Agree to call or declare interest/objection.\r\n5. Process is private, anonymous.\r\n6. Make good points = +rep\r\n7. Flag bad points (-rep)\r\n8. Resolution reached (+rep for all)\r\n9. Results go public.\r\n￼\r\n￼￼￼￼Questioner may post time-limit (perhaps)\r\n￼\r\n### ￼Selection process\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼Question may be tagged with n categories.\r\n1. Obtain list of all members who cover at least one of those categories.\r\n2. Randomly select 12, + 12 stand-bys.\r\n3. Send invites - need response within d days.\r\n4. No response => -1 rep\r\n5. Objection => OK, next time.\r\n6. Pick first 12 who accept.\r\n￼\r\n￼### Jury size\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼Not necessarily 12.\r\nLarger numbers for harder tasks => more time\r\n(use some formula).\r\nSuggest questioner needs more Rep to be able\r\nto call on larger numbers.\r\nNot sure about min, max.\r\n￼￼\r\n### ￼Deliberation process\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼Wholly online. Essentially a free-form or threaded comment approach to working through the issues. Collaborative/wiki editing facility to produce the one single answer.\r\n+rep for good responses, -rep for bad/disruptive ones. Kept even if no resolution. Also fun SO-style \"badges\".\r\nQuestioner may be able to guide process (see later)\r\n(Jurors may drop out and be replaced)\r\n￼\r\n### ￼Users: who?\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼Anyone (probably English-speaking)\r\n... who has provided enough information to at least give us a chance of stopping sockpuppetry...\r\nNo expertise required.\r\n￼\r\n### ￼Questions: what?\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼Want:\r\n\r\n* Yes/no questions.\r\n* Pick good/logical arguments, eliminate bad*\r\narguments from piece X.\r\n* 11-1, 12-0 votes.\r\n\r\nDo not want:\r\n* Create/rewrite piece X.\r\n* Two answers (left/right split, etc.)\r\n* 7-5, 8-4 votes.\r\n￼\r\n￼￼￼￼There will be clean-up:\r\n* Suggest similar questions (SO-style) to suppress duplicates.\r\n* Bad/unanswerable questions can be rejected (SO-style).\r\n* +rep for curating users.\r\n\r\n(Need some examples - and to work through some for real!)\r\n￼\r\n￼￼￼￼So, no need to worry about question suitability, or be put off asking:\r\n* If question is rejected, try again until it can be answered.\r\n* Make it worth answering to get best results. => Ensure process works for both sides\r\n￼\r\n### ￼Questions: who?\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼Any registered user.\r\nNot emergent decision-making: debates are commissioned:\r\n* By/within political institutions\r\n* By/within companies\r\n* Academic interest\r\n* Intellectual curiosity.\r\n￼\r\n￼### Questions: bounties\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼Just like Stack Overflow (I hope)\r\nHigh rep users can allocate some of their rep to new questions, which will be shared among jurors when resolution reached.\r\nNo other kind of \"sponsoring\".\r\n￼\r\n### ￼Resolution\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼Questioner must be satisfied with answer for this system to be credible, get a good reputation, and convince jurors it's worth giving their best.\r\nMust be possible for questioners to reject shoddy work (but still public)\r\n￼\r\n### ￼Resolution: how?\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼How can we be sure questioner is satisfied? Two possibilities:\r\n* 11-1 or 12-0 result. Questioner examines, either marks as accepted, or asks them to reconsider. (May not be practical)\r\n* Questioner has semi-read-only access to discussion. Can accept early, or intervene to guide things.\r\n￼\r\n￼### Keep the game going\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼\"Players\" must be able to control how much they get to do, in spite of random element.\r\n* Questions ÷ Jurors rises?: not necessarily\r\n* But, the more topics they choose, the more\r\nwork (as long as they maintain quality!)\r\n* Topics curated, split up, increased over time.\r\n￼\r\n￼￼￼￼Reputation and wanting-to-help should maintain interest (just like Stack Overflow)\r\nThese \"games\" must be a big deal for the outside world, not frivolous. Each one should get serious attention and publicity.\r\n￼\r\n## ￼￼Going further...\r\n￼￼￼￼\r\n￼### Avenues... I\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼Political questions, for starters. What else? # Workplace matters?\r\n* ...\r\nNot commercially viable (ads would be insane, as would be paid accounts), but fundable. What do Stack Overflow do? Could even collaborate with them.\r\n￼\r\n### ￼Avenues... II\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼There is potential to play these out offline. For games to actually run real experiments.\r\nTo actually commission research/call for expertise.\r\nAlmost like a jury running a criminal investigation, before: charges, suspect, legal case, and courtroom.\r\n￼\r\n### ￼Crowdsourcing\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼Loosen definition of \"jury\" a little =>\r\n\"working group\"\r\nCan take part in data cleanup and research exercises, rather like The Guardian's expenses thing from 2009.\r\nAgainst, not on basis of expertise, but enthusiasm.\r\n￼￼￼\r\n￼### Lotteries\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼Each +rep => ticket in User lottery Badges => tickets in Community lottery\r\nE.g. Company offers 1000 prizes (money, free subs, etc.) for each, 1000 numbers to win.\r\nBig motivator, but corruptible?\r\n=> No. Rep can't be gamed. Freely & openly given by others. Doesn't affect juries/Qs/As\r\n￼\r\n￼￼## Questions, Issues, ...\r\n￼￼￼￼\r\n￼### Proper relation with Govts\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼Be an international institution, independent of all Govts.\r\nRandomness & process should ensure this, but worth making this crystal-clear to users.\r\nGovts should come to us, to commission questions just as any other user can.\r\n￼\r\n### ￼Cheating\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼The process is entirely anonymous, so participants can't collude within the process.\r\nMay have to protect URLs to ensure they can't share links/advertise their status outside of the process.\r\nAll results ultimately go public.\r\n￼\r\n￼￼￼￼The public profiles of participants can then be checked against results. Those who should have declared an interest and opted-out can be questioned in public => possible big -rep or exclusion.\r\nMinimum 50? users per question-category, so particular areas cannot be hogged by same people.\r\n￼\r\n### ￼Random points\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼* International, yes, but must agree on language => English only.\r\n* Self-managing wherever possible.\r\n* No country/age/gender monitoring/equality\r\n* Rep does not bring more/better work!\r\n* Quorum: we'll replace drop-outs up to\r\ncertain number, but if (say) 50% drop out during life time, process suspended (dropout count is hidden from participants to prevent gaming)\r\n￼\r\n### ￼Unresolved issues\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼* Do what for -rep people?\r\n* National, centralised policy-making still a\r\ndead-end, so what's the point of resolving\r\nanything?\r\n* Modelling problem (market vs. planning):\r\nexperiment, do, feed back - don't try to\r\nresolve on paper.\r\n* Possibility of bias, as some categories will be\r\nself-selecting, e.g. \"gender politics\" will attract a certain kind of juror.
